# Wrangle Data
Udacity Second Data Analysis Project

# Description
The goal of this project is to show that I can use python to wrangle data. Data wrangling involves gathering the data, assessing it for dirtiness
and untidiness, and then clean it. This project involve gathering 3 different datasets from twitter WeRateDog page through at least 3 different means. 
Any 3 of the following methods can be used; direct download, programmatic download, API or Web scarpping. Twitter denied me access to their API,
so i used only the first two to gather the datasets. I assessed the 3 datasets (using pandas and numpy) for dirtness and messiness. I cleaned the datasets 
and merged them into a single master dataframe. I then used matplotlib for some visualisations.
