    "**Three** different datasets were used for this project. I downloaded the **'twitter-archived-enhanced.csv'** dataset  **manually** from the Udacity classroom, while the **'image_prediction.tsv'** file was **programatically** downloaded using the request library also from the link provided in the Udacity classroom. Both were loaded in the Jupyter Notebook using the Pandas library. Finally, I downloaded the **'twitter-json.text'** directly from the Udacity classroom because Twitter declined my verifiction request for their **API Keys** and the one provided the classroom has expired. I used the **Json, Operator and pandas libraries** to load this data in the Jupyter Notebook."

Re-extract the ratings (Some of the ratings in the were meant to be in decimal and all should be rated over 10). The datatypes of the day and the rating_numerator columns are inappropriate. The column name of the rating_numerator columns is also inappropriate. In the dog 'name' column, some names are inappropriate and the started with small letters. The p1, p2, and p3 columns in the image_prediction datasets are inappropriate. The following columns 'retweeted_status_id', 'retweeted_status_timestamp', 'text', 'rating_denominator, 'expanded_urls', 'doggo', 'floofer', 'pupper','puppo','new_rating' are not necessary for this analysis."

Also, the rating_numerators were re-extracted from the text column and the column name was changed to rating and datatype to float. All the inappropriate Dog names that started with small letter and the None were converted to 'No Name' and all the columns not required were deleted. Lastly, the p1,p2, and p3 columns in the image_prediction dataset were coverted from string to categorical datatype."
